Hi Asha :)

When I ran your code, I got an error on line 21 ( p = 1 1e^10-5 ). 
I'm not sure what that line was for and have ignored it for the moment. 

Using whatever I could decipher from your code ( I'm a little rusty with statistics :-P ), 
I was able to write some code. Hopefully it's of some use to you :-P
